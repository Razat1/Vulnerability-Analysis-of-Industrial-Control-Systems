Final year project done in last year of university. 

# Project Overview: Enhancing Cybersecurity for Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
In response to a staggering 2000% increase in cyber attacks on Industrial Control System (ICS) assets since 2018, this project aimed to address vulnerabilities in major infrastructures such as oil and gas, electricity, and water distribution. The study delved into the technological and security aspects, emphasising the impact of these attacks on the economy and society.

# Scope and Focus:
The project focused on vulnerabilities within ICS, particularly in supervisory control and data acquisition systems. It highlighted the increasing sophistication of cyber threats and the lack of cybersecurity measures in major infrastructures. Special attention was given to the detrimental effects on critical systems like water distribution, essential for human life.

# Technology Stack:
For system implementation, the Visual Studio Code editor was employed throughout the development process. Recognised for its speed and feature-rich environment, Visual Studio Code facilitated efficient coding. The choice of PHP as the programming language was influenced by its ability to interact with diverse databases, including the one integrated into the project. The PDO (PHP Data Objects) library within PHP was specifically utilised to enhance the security of the login system.

# Key Findings:
    The vulnerabilities in ICS were linked to exploiting known weaknesses in supervisory control and data acquisition systems.
    Hackers' increasing sophistication was attributed to the absence of robust cybersecurity measures in major infrastructures.
    Various attack methods, such as ransomware, phishing, social engineering, and password spraying, were identified as significant threats.

# Solutions Proposed:
The project proposed potential solutions to mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of cyber attacks. Emphasis was placed on addressing weak password protection, especially in critical infrastructures.

# Conclusion:
The project provided a comprehensive overview of the cybersecurity landscape in ICS, with a focus on major infrastructures. The utilisation of Visual Studio Code and PHP, along with the strategic implementation of the PDO library, contributed to a secure and efficient system. The findings and proposed solutions underscored the urgency of addressing cybersecurity gaps to safeguard critical infrastructures and, consequently, the well-being of society.
